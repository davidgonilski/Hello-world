# Hello-world
I am Molecular Biologist PhD Student at the Buenos Aires University (UBA), Argentina working in the Biomedicine Institute of Buenos Aires. I am highly interested in understanding the genetic regulatory networks and molecular signal pathways that drive kidney cancer.
The main aim of my study is to understand the mechanisms behind tumorigenesis and improve treatments in kidney cancer. I focus on the RSUME oncogeneâ€™s involvement in the development of Von Hippel Lindau tumors. I analyze genomic and transcriptomic datasets and perform wet lab experiments to support my findings.
